Solidity Basics Practice
Welcome to the Solidity Basics Practice repository! This repository is designed for developers who are new to Solidity and want to practice writing smart contracts. Here, you'll find a series of exercises and challenges to help you learn and master the fundamentals of Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development.

Getting Started
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that you'll use to run the development tools.
npm: A package manager for JavaScript, which comes with Node.js.
Truffle: A development framework for Ethereum that makes it easy to compile, deploy, and test smart contracts.
Ganache: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development that you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests.
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidity-basics-practice.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
cd solidity-basics-practice
Install the dependencies:
npm install
Exercises
The contracts/ directory contains a set of Solidity contracts that are structured to teach you the basics of Solidity. Each contract focuses on a specific topic or concept.

Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

HelloWorld.sol: Learn how to write your first simple contract in Solidity.
Counter.sol: Implement a simple counter contract that can increase and decrease in value.
SimpleStorage.sol: Create a contract that can store and retrieve values.
Token.sol: Build a basic ERC20 token contract.
To practice, navigate to the corresponding exercise file, read the comments, and fill in the missing code as instructed.

Testing
To run tests and validate your solutions, navigate to the test/ directory. Each contract has a corresponding test file with a set of test cases.

Run the tests using Truffle:

truffle test
